# About Me

Welcome! I'm **Geno** — a storyteller and world-builder with a passion for exploring both imaginative and everyday experiences.

As of **October 6, 2025**, I have consolidated my creative work into this collective SPA (Single Page Application) Database. Everything here is presented as canonical within its respective universe, serving both as an encyclopedia and a personal blog. I am European and have a strong interest in gaming.

## Areas of Focus

- **Writing:** Stories, books, and bestiary entries. I am a lore enthusiast and prioritize realism when exploring the motivations and logic behind events in a story.  
- **Game Development:** I design and develop games, primarily using Pygame.  
- **Content Creation:** Former streamer and YouTuber, experienced in producing engaging media content.  
- **Coding:** I enjoy working deeply with source code, whether as a video game modder or a programmer exploring new projects.

## Games I Play

- **Geometry Dash:** Though I haven't played recently, I have always found it exceptionally fun and challenging.  
- **Terraria:** A longtime fan; I also create challenge mods to enhance gameplay.  
- **Minecraft:** From childhood to today, I continue to enjoy this sandbox classic.  
- **Hollow Knight:** A more recent discovery, now one of the games I appreciate on a deeper, almost spiritual level.  
- **Pokémon:** I used to play competitively and have completed every game available to me. My favorite Pokémon is always Leafeon.

For anyone inclined to stalk or invade my privacy: I value my personal space. If you manage to find my address from this information alone, first of all—seriously, get help. Secondly, I strongly advise against sharing or posting any of that information publicly. If you do discover where I live, at least keep it to yourself. I'm a person, too, and it's worth thinking about how you’d feel if someone did that to you.
