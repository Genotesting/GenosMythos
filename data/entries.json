  "content": "<h1>Corythrigon — <em>The Scourge</em></h1><p><strong>Category:</strong> Creature</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> 20–30 feet</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Underground, dimly lit caves. Lives in packs rather than solitary ambush or stealth.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The Corythrigon is a serpentine beast with a singular head and multiple powerful tails (commonly 5–6) armed with prongs and spikes. Its name derives from the words <em>Coryth</em>, meaning 'helmet' or 'armored', and <em>rigon</em>, meaning 'drizzle'—a nod to the violent whipping action of its tails, as if the prey is being 'drizzled by whips'. Unlike most snakes, it possesses a rare dual skeleton—an internal bone structure and an external exoskeletal ridge system that provides added durability.</p><h2>Behavior</h2><p>Packs are alpha-led; the alpha is larger with more tails. They don’t ambush indiscriminately — they hunt selectively when motivated. Packs often erupt into violent fights over food. Adults sharpen tails by slamming them against rockfaces and chip stones build nesting material.</p><h2>Abilities & Notes</h2><ul><li>Tails used for constriction and whipping; can rip through metal and tear a car in half in mythic accounts.</li><li>Tail spikes regrow over time like fingernails; lost tails do not regenerate.</li><li>Related conceptually to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra\">hydra</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda\">anaconda</a> but diverges in social behavior and habitat.</li></ul>"

Its ventral side is smooth, enabling efficient guidance of smaller debris, while its beak is metallic-toned and emits a faint shimmer when activating its magnetic field.
